				<h2>Introduction</h2>
			</div>
			<div id="intropara" class="textpara">
			Negotiations over North Korea’s nuclear program have occurred for nearly 25 years. There are few open-source studies that have explored the entire record of nuclear diplomacy between North Korea and the United States.  Additionally, very few studies have tested the relationship between negotiations and other variables to explain historical outcomes.  This analysis examines the history of talks between the U.S. and North Korea and seeks to determine if there are trends that could shed light on how effective diplomacy is in altering North Korea’s behavior.
			</div>
			<div class="headingWrapper">
				<h2>Key Findings</h2>
			</div>
			

			<div class="textpara keyfindings">
				<ul>
					<li>There appears to be an inverse correlation between U.S.-DPRK diplomacy and the frequency of North Korean provocations in this 25-year period. That is, there is a correlation between periods when the U.S. is at the negotiating table with North Korea, in a bilateral or multilateral setting, and a decrease in DPRK provocations.</li>
					<li>The absence of missile tests or other kinetic provocations does not necessarily suggest a halt in North Korean weapons development or a reduction of the overall nuclear threat. But, diplomacy does seem to have some restraining effect on the number of provocations carried out.</li>
					<li>The ratio of negotiations to provocations is highest under North Korean leader Kim Il-sung from 1990 to 1994. The ratio of negotiations to provocations is lowest under North Korean leader Kim Jong-un from 2012 to the present.</li>
					<li>Whether the U.S. president is a Democrat or Republican, party control of the White House appears to have no effect on the pace of North Korean provocations.</li>
					<li>Negotiations under Kim Jong-un hit historic lows in comparison to his predecessors, even when accounting for tenure in office.</li>

				After a visit to North Korea by former president Jimmy Carter in June 1994, however, the U.S. and North Korea returned to dialogue.  All six negotiations that took place in the summer and fall of 1994 were focused on achieving the <a href="https://beyondparallel.csis.org/living-history-with-robert-gallucci/" target="_blank">October 1994 Agreed Framework.</a>
			</p>
			<p class="textpara">
				In the process, North Korea agreed to freeze and eventually dismantle its nuclear reactors and allow IAEA inspectors to monitor the implementation process. In exchange, the U.S. agreed to provide two light-water reactor power plants, energy assistance, and security assurances while working toward normalization of bilateral relations.
			</p>
			<p class="textpara" id="regime1end">

				The Korean Peninsula Energy Development Organization (KEDO) was formed to implement the provision of light-water reactors under the agreement. There were also attempts to hold Three-Party Talks (U.S.-DPRK-ROK) and Four-Party Talks (U.S.-DPRK-ROK-CHN) in the period between 1997 and 1999. Bilateral U.S. and North Korean missile talks also took place from 1996 to 2000.

There were a total of <span class="negotiationColor">64 bilateral and multilateral negotiations</span> that took place. The majority of these were conducted as a part of the Six-Party Talks process, involving the United States, Japan, China, Russia, and the two Koreas. These negotiations began after revelations of a clandestine North Korean highly enriched uranium (HEU) program in October 2002, which eventually brought an end to KEDO and the Agreed Framework.

			<p class="textpara">
				Six-Party Talks diplomacy started in August 2003 and achieved a denuclearization agreement, embodied in the <a href="https://beyondparallel.csis.org/living-history-ambassador-christopher-hill/" target="_blank">September 2005 Six-Party Joint Statement</a>. In this agreement, North Korea agreed to abandon development of all its nuclear weapons and existing nuclear programs and to abide by a verification process.

			<p class="textpara">
				There was a nine-month hiatus in negotiations between January 2006 and October 2006 during which North Korea conducted several provocations, but negotiations resumed from December 2006. This led to an agreement in February 2007 on implementation of the 2005 Joint Statement. Negotiations related to compliance with the Six-Party agreements continued through December 2008.
			</p>

			<p class="textpara">
				There were a total of <span class="provocationColor">27 North Korean provocations</span> during this eight-year period. Between the collapse of the Agreed Framework and the start of the Six-Party Talks in early 2003, there was a slight uptick in conventional and missile provocations.
			</p>
			<p class="textpara">
				As negotiations restarted in 2004 and 2005, the provocation numbers started to recede, suggesting that talks may have restrained North Korea in part from carrying out further provocations. By contrast during the period of non-dialogue that spanned nine months in 2006, North Korea carried out a series of provocations, including ballistic missile tests in July 2006 and a nuclear test in October 2006.

			</p>
			<p class="textpara" id="bushend">
				An incidental finding of this period, when compared with the previous one, is that Pyongyang does not seem to discriminate in terms of which party holds power in the U.S. White House. They carry out provocations in both Democratic and Republican administrations.

There are only <span class="negotiationColor">3 official bilateral DPRK-U.S. negotiations</span> conducted over a three-year period. This dataset includes only official meetings in the public domain. It does not include track 1.5/2.0 dialogues between private citizens and North Korean officials or private visits to Pyongyang.
			</p>
			
			<p class="textpara">
				The data shows not only a noticeable absence of negotiations but also a corresponding <a href="https://missilethreat.csis.org/north-korea-missile-launches-1984-present/" target="_blank">increase in North Korean provocations</a> particularly of ballistic missile launches over a shorter period of time.
			</p>
			
			<p class="textpara">
				North Korea carried out <span class="provocationColor">17 provocations</span>, a majority of which were missile launches and a nuclear test in 2009. Deadly military exchanges in the West Sea around the Northern Limit Line (NLL) also occurred in 2010.

			<p class="textpara" id="regime2end">
				This shows that North Korea did not appear to discriminate between Democratic and Republican U.S. presidents in carrying out provocations. Indeed, the regime seems more responsive to the frequency of negotiations as a variable than to the party in power in Washington. This period ends in December 2011 with the death of Kim Jong-il and the ascension of Kim Jong-un to power.

				This period has the second lowest ratio of negotiations to provocations at [<span class="negotiationColor">1</span> : <span class="provocationColor">31.5</span>]. There were <span class="negotiationColor">2 official negotiations</span> during this period and a total of <span class="provocationColor">63 provocation events</span>. The two negotiations that occurred were associated with the &#8220;Leap Day Agreement,&#8221; an attempt to get North Korea to freeze its nuclear weapons program in exchange for U.S. food aid. (Secret visits to Pyongyang, such as the one made by Director of National Intelligence James Clapper in November 2014, were not counted in this dataset).  
			</p>
			<p class="textpara">
				The deal fell apart when North Korea launched a Taepodong 2 (Unha-3) rocket in April 2012. The United States enunciated a policy of &#8220;strategic patience,&#8221; vowing not to return to negotiations until North Korea demonstrated that it would commit to denuclearization. The United States and North Korea did not conduct any formal negotiations in the public domain between March 2012 and January 2017. Secret meetings and other track 1.5/2.0 dialogues were not included in this dataset. 
			</p>

			<p class="textpara">
				An incidental finding is the drop-off in the number of formal negotiations under Kim Jong-un relative to his predecessors, even accounting for tenure in office. From 1990 to the present, significantly more negotiations happened under Kim Il-sung (26) and Kim Jong-il (175) than Kim Jong-un (2).
			</p>
			<p class="textpara">
				The data in this period shows a significant increase in the number and intensity of North Korean provocations. On 63 different occasions between January 2012 and December 2016, North Korea carried out over 70 missile tests and 3 nuclear tests.

			<p class="textpara" id="bothend">
				At the current pace, North Korea may do well over 100 missile tests during the four-year term of the U.S. president, which would represent a historic high. <!--The current ratio of negotiations to provocations is [<span class="negotiationColor">0</span> : <span class="provocationColor">1</span>].-->

				<h2>Conclusion</h2>
			</div>
			
			<p class="textpara" id="para12">
				Periods of negotiation between the United States and North Korea in a bilateral or multilateral format appear to have some correlation with a decrease in the number of North Korean provocations. Those in favor of dialogue with North Korea might see this as evidence of the efficacy of diplomacy. Skeptics will argue that the absence of North Korean provocations does not necessarily mean that nuclear proliferation, both horizontal and vertical, is not still occurring during these periods. However, there is no denying that a decrease in nuclear provocations by North Korea would be a welcome development.
